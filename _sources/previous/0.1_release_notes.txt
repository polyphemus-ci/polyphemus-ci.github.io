Polyphemus 0.1 Release Notes
=============================

~ One eye makes for shallow bugs ~ 

Polyphemus is a continuous integration tool that front-ends to GitHub et al. and 
backends to BaTLaB. This fills a similar role to that of Travis-CI or the GitHub 
plugin for Jenkins. However, BaTLab has a wider vareity of machines than Travis-CI 
and is cheaper (free) than running your own machines with Jenkins.

Polyphemus supports Apache 2.

Examples of a running polyphemus may be seen for the Cylus project at 
`the project dashboard <http://cyclus-ci.fuelcycle.org/dashboard>`_ and 
`github <https://github.com/cyclus/cyclus/pulls>`_.
